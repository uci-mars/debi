### Overview

EM Health is a dedicated moblie app with a responsive website. EM Health offer a wide range of lessons in basic first aid as well as quizzes to test the userâ€™s knowledge.  The typical user is between 18 - 40 years old. EM Health goal is to increase access to quality education in developing countries for all users.

#### The Problem:

People in economically developing nations do not have access to essential education such as providing basic first aid. There is a lack of general knowledge and limited understanding about providing first aid to oneself and society.

#### The Goal:
Design a user friendly learning app to increase access to quality education.

### Understanding the User

#### User Research: Summary 

I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and userâ€™s needs. A primary user group identified through research was users who had little to no education about basic knowledge and the practice of first aid.

### Starting the Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Digital Wireframe</h4>
      <p>As the initial design phase continued, the screen designs were based on feedback and findings from the user research.</p>
      <p>After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I created the inital designs for the EM Health app, These designs focused on providing education through a simple and easy to read format. </p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype</h4>
      <p>The low-fidelity prototype connected the primary user flow of creating an account, selecting a lesson, and taking a practice quiz, so the prototype could be used in a usability study with users.</p>

### Refining the Design

#### Mockups

      <p>After the usability study, I applied design changes like providing a clear section from the home screen to browse and select lessons.</p>

### Going Forward

#### What I Learned:

While designing the EM Health app, I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the appâ€™s design.  

#### Next Steps:
1. Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need.
