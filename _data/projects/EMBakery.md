### Overview

EM Bakery is a U.S. based bakery and café. EM Bakery Café offer a wide range of desserts, hot coffee, and tea.  The typical user is between 18 - 30 years old. EM Bakery Café goal is to make online ordering easy and convenient for commuters and workers on the go.

#### The Problem:

Busy workers and commuters lack the time neccessary to prepare and order in-store.

#### The Goal:
Design a user friendly app that allows users to easily order and pick up baked goods and coffee that works with their schedule.

### Understanding the User

#### User Research: Summary 

I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and user’s needs. A primary user group identified through research was users purchasing cakes for the holidays and their need to easily place an order in advance.

This user group confirmed initial assumption about Em Bakery Café customers, but further research also revealed that users wanted an app that is user friendly and accessible. 

#### User Research: Pain Points
IA: Text-heavy menus in apps are often difficult to read and order from.

### Starting the Design

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Digital Wireframe</h4>
      <p>As the initial design phase continued, the screen designs were based on feedback and findings from the user research.</p>
      <p>Easy navigation was a key user need to address in the design in addition to a fast checkout process.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype</h4>
      <p>The low-fidelity prototype connected the primary user flow of browsing and placing an order, so the prototype could be used in a usability study with users.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Refining the Design

#### Mockups
<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">
      <h4>Before usuability study</h4>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align: center">
      <h4>After usuability study</h4>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/assets/projects/EMBakery/3.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="/assets/projects/EMBakery/4.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Acessibility Considerations 
I used headings with different sized text for clear visual hierarchy. 
Landmarks were used to help users navigate the site.

### Going Forward

#### What I Learned:

While designing the EM Bakery Café app, I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app’s design.  

#### Next Steps:
1. Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed.
2. Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need.
