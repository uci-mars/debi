### Overview

EM Jewelry is a international jewelry brand based in Singapore. EM Jewelry offer a wide range of jewelry and specializes in jewelry that are suitable for sensitive skin, tarnish and sweat resistant.  The typical user is between 18 - 30 years old. EM Jewlery goal is to make shopping fun, fast, and easy for all users.

#### The Problem:

Available online shopping apps have cluttered designs, inefficient systems for browsing through products, and confusing checkout processes.

#### The Goal:
Design a user friendly shopping app by providing clear navigation and a fast checkout process.

### Understanding the User

#### User Research: Summary 

I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and user’s needs. A primary user group identified through research was users who treat online shopping as a relaxing and therupetic activity. 

This user group confirmed initial assumption about EM Jewelry customers, but further research also revealed that users wanted an app that is user friendly and creates an enjoyable experience. 

#### User Research: Pain Points
