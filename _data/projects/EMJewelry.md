### Overview

EM Jewelry is a international jewelry brand based in Singapore. EM Jewelry offer a wide range of jewelry and specializes in jewelry that are suitable for sensitive skin, tarnish and sweat resistant.  The typical user is between 18 - 30 years old. EM Jewlery goal is to make shopping fun, fast, and easy for all users.

#### The Problem:

Available online shopping apps have cluttered designs, inefficient systems for browsing through products, and confusing checkout processes.

#### The Goal:
Design a user friendly shopping app by providing clear navigation and a fast checkout process.

### Understanding the User

#### User Research: Summary 

I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and user‚Äôs needs. A primary user group identified through research was users who treat online shopping as a relaxing and therupetic activity. 

This user group confirmed initial assumption about EM Jewelry customers, but further research also revealed that users wanted an app that is user friendly and creates an enjoyable experience.

### Starting the Design

    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Digital Wireframe</h4>
      <p>As the initial design phase continued, the screen designs were based on feedback and findings from the user research.<br/>Easy navigation was a key user need to address in the design.</p>

  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype</h4>
      <p>The low-fidelity prototype connected the primary user flow of browsing and placing an order, so the prototype could be used in a usability study with users.</p>

#### Usuabilty Study: Parameters
|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|**Study type:**|**Location:**|**Participants:**|**Length:**|
|Unmoderated usuability study|United States, remote|5 participants|20-30 minutes|

#### Usuability Study: Findings
1. Users had difficulty understanding the user flow.
2. Users had difficulty returning to the starting points.
3. Users had difficulty with the buttons.

### Refining the Design

#### Mockups

      <p>After the usability study, the category were more spaced out, allowing users to have a bigger touch target/clickable area. The design was revised to have a cleaner and more focused design.</p>

### Going Forward

#### What I Learned:

While designing the EM Jewelry app, I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app‚Äôs design.  

#### Next Steps:
1. Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed.
2. Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need.
